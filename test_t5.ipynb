Schizophrenia is altogether very different disorder where people have abnormal perceptions such as hearing voices when no one is present and seeing objects when nothing is there. I do not see any of them with you. In my view, you need to put your worries at rest and do what your mind and heart considers right. It may be abnormal for your mother, but there is no pathology with this. If you feel more assistance is required or my answer to your query is far from setting down the worries, then it is better to see a psychiatrist in person. For further information consult a psychiatrist online -->\",\n",
